# Bike-theft_Detection ðŸš²ðŸ‘®ðŸ’²
The Bike Theft Detection project aims to address the prevalent issue of vehicle theft on ASU's campus by leveraging computer vision technology. With 118 reported incidents of bike theft during the Fall 2022 semester alone, it is crucial to implement an effective solution that provides peace of mind for individuals parking their bikes, scooters, or skateboards on campus.

This project utilizes the YOLOv5 object detection algorithm to detect bikes in surveillance camera footage. By analyzing large amounts of image data, captured by strategically placed cameras at various parking locations, suspicious activities and individuals related to bike theft can be identified. The system also incorporates facial recognition capabilities using the facenet-Pytorch and MTCNN algorithms to compare faces detected in the footage.

To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the model, 362 online images of bikes and scooters with people were used for training. Mock photos were also taken, featuring owners with their bikes and other individuals with the same bike, to evaluate the model's ability to identify potential theft. This iterative approach allowed for improvements in the model's performance based on identified weaknesses.

By implementing this computer vision-based solution, individuals on campus can park their vehicles with peace of mind, without the constant worry of theft. Moreover, the system's efficiency and reliability enable students and staff to focus on their studies and work, leading to improved academic performance and increased satisfaction for everyone on campus.

Please note that the actual implementation details and code for this project can be found on the GitHub repository.
